# TODO

- final rendering should be from fixed-size framebuffer to screen
- make small test

# BUGS

## test-video

### Linux

* no KeyRelease message
* mouse wheel shows up in MousePress + MouseRelease
* no mouse button codes
- key codes might be problematic -> as warning
- no icon in taskbar -> solve later 

# STYLE

- width() and height() instead of width and height
